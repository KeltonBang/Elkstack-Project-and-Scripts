This is a collection of my Linux scripts and my Ansible scripts i created when i attended the KU Cybersecurity Bootcamp

The linux scripts were used to sort through the Lucky Duck Casino dealer and player data to find who was cheating at the roulette table. 


The Ansible scripts were used to configure my cloud servers with docker containers.


My final setup had 3 webservers (DVWA containers) along with a Jump Box Provisioner, and a vm server running an ELK stack container.
